# Explaining PyVis

PyVis is split up into different files, depending on the user's needs. For instance, if the user needs to plot data points 
in a strike zone, the aptly named `strike_zone.py` file will do so. At the top of each function is a brief explanation as to 
what the function does. The `data.py` file is the "initializer" as it has all of the imports needed for all files and has the 
main function used to scrape the data for all other functions in PyVis. Hence, in all other files, the only import statement 
is `import data`.
