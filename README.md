# PyVis
PyVis is a data visualization tool that is an extension of [pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball).

## Getting Started
See below on how to start using PyVis.

### Prerequisites
First, you need to install `pybaseball` by typing the following into the command line: `pip install pybaseball`. If you don't have `pip`, install it [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

It is recommended that you replace any local files installed by `pip` with the files from the `pybaseball` repo, as some functions in `PyVis` use updated functions that have not been updated in the `pip` installation.

## How PyVis Works
See [Explaining PyVis.md](https://github.com/kunalcsc630/pyvis/blob/master/pyvis/Explaining%20PyVis.md) to learn more about the capabilities of PyVis. Have fun visualizing!
