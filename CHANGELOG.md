# Change Log

## Jan 26
I've updated my README to be more like a README for an actual open source repo. I also looked more into pybaseball and discovered that the function works if you call it with specific syntax. I'm also noticing that I'm going to need to spend more time understanding the inner workings of pybaseball before I can begin working on my own open source library.

## Jan 29
Over the weekend, I worked on understanding pybaseball. I now have a fairly good idea of how it works. Now, I'll need to start working on my repo and writing improvements to pybaseball.
