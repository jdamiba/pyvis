# Change Log

## Jan 26
I've updated my README to be more like a README for an actual open source repo. I also looked more into pybaseball and discovered that the function works if you call it with specific syntax. I'm also noticing that I'm going to need to spend more time understanding the inner workings of pybaseball before I can begin working on my own open source library.

## Jan 28
Over the weekend, I worked on understanding pybaseball. I now have a fairly good idea of how it works. Now, I'll need to start working on my repo and writing improvements to pybaseball.

## Jan 29
I realize that I need to learn the inner workings of matplotlib because there are so many different things you can do with it. That way, I'll know what kinds of graphs I want to quickly generate in my library.
